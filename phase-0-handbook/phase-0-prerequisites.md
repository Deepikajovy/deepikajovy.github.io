# Phase 0 Prerequisities

#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts for Phase 0. The general rule of thumb is to use your first name as part of your username wherever possible and include a photo of yourself.

- [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)<br> We use Google Hangouts and Communities throughout Phase 0  **Make sure to activate Google+ on this account**. Please upload a photo of you (not your cat or bike) to help the Dev Academy community of staff, teachers, coaches and alumni recognise you.   

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible. 

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github today, so please create an account. **Please use your first name as part of your github user name.** This will be where you keep all of your code from EDA and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs.

- [Socrates](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/)<br> You will receive an individual invite to socrates - The DevBoot Camp app that Dev Academy uses for activities like giving feedback. 

- [Slack](https://ensprial-dev-academy.slack.com/messages/)<br> You’ll receive an invite shortly to join our Slack channel. We’ll use Slack to help with quick fire questions and answers. You can also post files, notifications, and get help from the EDA and Pukeko community. We recommend using either the desktop app or have the web app signed on when you are working through the Phase 0 material.  

- [Google+](http://plus.google.com)
By now you should have received an invite to your Pukeko Google+ community. If not, ask your facilitator to invite you. We’ll use G+ to share non-urgent information and to organise Google Hangouts.

#### 3. Personal Preparation

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (often at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Academy more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's also vital to practice explaining your ideas to others. *Keep track of the your explanations and results below.*

You need to be able to:

- Explain the difference between <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.

- Explain my <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what I enjoy or find challenging when learning


#### 4. Update your browser
It's very important that you're using the latest version of your web browser. For Phase 0, we recommend working with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).


#### 5. Typing and shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

Take a baseline <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a> to see how fast you currently type.

Then practice. Try <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a>[typing.io](http://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols. Typing can be fun to practice and you can't get too good at it.

For shortcuts, try <a href = "https://www.shortcutfoo.com/" target="_blank">shortcutfoo.com</a>. You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.

You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts in Sublime

#### 6. Read the [Phase 0 Handbook](readme.md)
This detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so please take time to read it and get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Academy!
