# Phase 0 Prerequisities

During the beginning of Phase 0, there are prerequisites that need to be met to ensure you are prepared for the experience. Please make sure to complete each task *prior to the start of Unit 2 (Week 4)*

## Tasks and Challenges

### Administrative
####1. Log in to [Socrates*](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/) and update your profile with the following:
   - [Github](https://github.com/) (MANDATORY)
   - [Google+](https://plus.google.com) (MANDATORY)
   - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) (OPTIONAL)
   - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) (OPTIONAL)
   - [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) (OPTIONAL) (this is where we pull your picture so make sure it's of your face!)
   - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (OPTIONAL)

####2. Request to join your Google+ Community. The link will be given to you in your Phase 0 Welcome email. 
This is **vital** to success in Phase 0. We communicate with students primarily through the community.

####3. [Watch "EQ: Engineering Empathy and Feedback"](http://vimeo.com/76762772) **It's important you watch the whole thing!**

####4. [Watch "Pairing is Caring"](https://vimeo.com/76662569)

####5. [Watch the "Stypi Tutorial"](https://vimeo.com/76870082)

### Competency-Based

####1. Complete the [Prep Objectives](prep-competencies.md)

####2. Review sections from Ruby Labs in Socrates. *(This is not intended to teach you everything you need for the exercises, but is meant to be a review of the Prep Objectives)*
   - [Introduction](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/ruby/introduction)
   - [Primitives](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/ruby/primitives/)
   - [Methods](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/ruby/methods/)
   - [Branching](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/ruby/branching)
   - [Collections](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/ruby/collections/)

####3. **Complete all 20 Exercises in [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises)**. 
If you are confident with each prep objective on ruby, these should take you around 4-6 hours. If not, it will probably take longer, so give yourself some time. It's important to have basic fundamentals before starting Phase 0. 



* You will receive an email from Socrates with login information one week prior to the start of Phase 0.
