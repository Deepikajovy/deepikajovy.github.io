# Guidelines for Submitting Challenges

At this point, you should be working entirely off your forked copy of the phase zero repository. If you don't already have a local copy of this repo on your computer, you'll have to clone one down. If you've forgotten how, please refer back to the [Git Practice](../../unit_1/week_1/git_practice/README.md) challenge from week 1.

## Navigate to the Challenge's Folder

Use terminal to find your challenge's folder, and open its contents with sublime. 

## Read the Instructions

This is obvious and self-explanatory, but nevertheless important to mention. Taking time to read the instructions can save you heaps of time + confusion.

## Work On Your Solution

Work smart and commit often. If necessary, write some pseudocode outlining your proposed solution. Then stage + commit. Whenever you get a part of your code working, stage + commit. When all your code works, stage + commit. After refactoring your solution, stage + commit. After refactoring your solution even further, stage + commit. 

## Submit Your Solution + Reflect

When you're done, push your commits up to github. Take time to reflect on what you learned. There is a tendency to finish and quickly move on -- this will be detrimental to your learning. Think about the tools you learned. Know what they're good for and know their limitations. You will surely use them again, so think about how you might use them in future problems. Think about the mistakes you made and try not to repeat them in the future. Think about how much more you know now compared to the week before.
