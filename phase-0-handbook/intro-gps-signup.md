# How to Sign Up for Intro Sessions and GPS

We are using google calendars to sign up for introductory sessions and GPSs. It's a bit of a learning curve
at first, but bear with us.

### Calendar Links
You will receive an email from patrick@devacademy.co.nz inviting you to Intro Sessions in you first week of Unit 1, and for GPS Sessions in later weeks.
Please RSVP as soon as possible so we know whether we need to reschedule in case you can't make it.

When the time for your Intro/GPS arrives, click the "Join Video Call" link in the invite.

If you have any issues getting into the session, please contact the session creator or coach (listed in the event). They will be able to help you.

If you have any questions, problems, or concerns, please contact us.

#### To Cancel a GPS Session
**You must cancel at least 6 hours in advance!** 

- Go to the calendar invite and change your availability
- **Email** your Phase 0 Co-ordinator and the Coach(es) who are also part of the GPS/Intro session to let everyone know.
