# Fibonacci Number?

## Learning Competencies
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on challenge requirements
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges

## Summary:
There are some interesting mathematical sequences that appear in nature. The [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is one of them. For this challenge, you will write a method to check if a number is part of that sequence.

There are many ways to do this, but you'll first have to understand how the sequence is built. Do a bit of research on that to begin.

Depending on your approach, you might find the need to use [BigDecimal](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/bigdecimal/rdoc/BigDecimal.html) for precise arithmetic.

For this challenge, make sure you understand every line of code you write.

## Release 0: Write [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Write your [initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Once you write the solution, run the [tests](fibonacci_spec.rb). If your initial solution passes all tests, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Translate RSpec
Translate as much of the RSpec as you can into [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md). Make sure your initial solution is passing all of the tests.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: Push!
