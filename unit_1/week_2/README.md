# Week 2: HTML + CSS

This week, you'll be completing a lot of treehouse tutorials. These tutorials are excellent, engaging, and really help to demystify HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of web design. 

Remember that personal website you set up last week with github pages? By the end of the week, you'll know how to build that up into something quite good. Have fun!
