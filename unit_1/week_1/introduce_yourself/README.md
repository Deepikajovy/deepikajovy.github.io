# Introduce Yourself

## Intro Email 
Each cohort has it's own email list visible on the cohort webpage. Email that list with the subject "self introduction" or reply to the main thread you received. In your email, include your:
- Name
- Location
- Why you're attending EDA
- What you are most excited to learn about
- When the best time for you to pair is

## Check in With Your Accountability Group
Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. You will have a challenge to connect/meet with them each week. As a group you can decide to connect weekly via hangouts, in person, or email. You will also get the chance to work with them on group challenges in later units, so it's important to start building relationships early. You may want to start a code review process within your accountability group as well.

Now that you've introduced yourself to your cohort, it's time to get to know your accountability group. You should have a link to your accountability groups in your Google+ Community. Contact the people in your accountability group via email with the following information:

Which challenge confused you the most this week
Which concepts you found most interesting
The city you currently live in
Your preferred way of connecting with the group each week (hangout, email, in person, if possible).

## AWWWWHHHHHHHHWHWHHWHHHHHH YEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
