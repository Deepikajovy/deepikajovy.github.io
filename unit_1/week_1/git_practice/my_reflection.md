## GitHub Reflection

Imagine you are talking to a non-techinical audience (your grandma, a 5-year old kid, your neighbor). How would you describe and explain: 
- Github 
- Version Control  

Consider the following and answer:
- Why  developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
- What doesn't make sense? What does?
