			<li>Onam is a festival celebrated by the Malayalees. Onam starts on the day of attam nakshatram and goes on for ten days till thiruvonam. The most important part of thiruvonam is the Thiruona Sadya. Sadhya is a vegetarian feast or banquet. The multi course meal is served traditionally in banana leaf.</li>
			<li>The sadhya is usually served for lunch. Preparations begin the night before, and the dishes are prepared before ten o' clock in the morning on the day of the celebration. On many occasions, sadhya is served on tables, as people no longer find it convenient to sit on the floor.</li>
			<li>Traditionally, the people of the neighborhood spent the night helping the cooks in cooking. They also volunteer to serve the food for the hosts to the guests. This involves a fair amount of social interaction which help build rapport with the neighbors.</li>
			<li>Sadhya is served in Pankthi (sanskrit) - panti in malayalam - meaning in lines or rounds where sets of people are served in sitting lines, on the floor earlier, now on benches and desks.
