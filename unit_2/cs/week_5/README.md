##Week 4


This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. Challenges will all be written in the NET REPL environment, which will compile, run and test your code against specific tests that have been written for each challenge. You are not expected to understand how test units work at this stage, but it doesn't hurt to start becoming familiar with them and you can view them on each exercise page by pressing the Show/Hide Tests button at the bottom.

## Challenge Format

For most of the following challenges you'll be using NET REPL.
NET REPL will allow you to write, execute and test code within a web environment. Once you're happy with your bit of code, please paste it into the my_solution.cs at each appropriate step (pseudo-code, initial code, refactor, etc).

##To-Do
1.




## Submitting your work

- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due by midnight on Sunday. (Otherwise it turns into a pumpkin)

**if you do not finish by the deadline:**

- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V)


# Week 5: Algorithms

## Challenges
1. [Mathy Challenges](1-mathy-intro)
2. [Separate Numbers with Commas SOLO CHALLENGE](4-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
3. [Pad an Array](5-pad-array)
4. [Cipher Challenge](6-cipher-challenge) *Pair with a person in your cohort*

## Working through the Challenges

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the 'my_solution.cs' files or the spec files.
