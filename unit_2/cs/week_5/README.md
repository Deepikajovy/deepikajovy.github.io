##Week 5: Algorythems

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. Remember to run your work in the NetRepl environment to have your code compiled and run against the unit tests for the challenge. This may mean copy pasting your code from a different dev environment, eg DotNetFiddle or LinqPad

You are not expected to understand how unit tests work at this stage, but it doesn't hurt to start becoming familiar with them and you can view them on each exercise page by pressing the Show/Hide Tests button at the bottom.

## Challenge Format
Once you're happy with your bit of code, please paste it into the my_solution.cs at each appropriate step (pseudo-code, initial code, refactor, etc).

##To-Do
1. [Numbers in range](exercises/15-numbers-in-range)
2. [Calculate Median](exercises/14-calculate-median)
3. [Find Mode](exercises/17-find-mode)
4. [Pad an Array](exercises/18-pad-array)
5. [Separate Numbers with Commas](exercises/19-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
6. [Cipher Challenge](exercises/20-cipher-challenge)
