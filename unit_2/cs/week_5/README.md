#Intro to weeks 5-7
The structure of the next three weeks present you with a list of videos to watch from Microsoft Virtual Academy C# fundamentals course, a list of EDA C# challenges and a list of stretch videos on PluralSight.

Expectations are that you make it through the videos on MVA and the challenges. The stretch videos are there for you to watch if you have time.

While watching the videos on Virtual Academy it may be helpful to open Visual Studio and follow along. Also note that the tutorials are screen casts of Visual Studio 2010, which differs slightly in the user interface. Its ok you just want to be focusing on the code. If you do bump into an oddity please reach out on slack for guidance.

You will be using Visual Studio to solve the challenges provided, all of which have tests that you will run to determine if your code is performing as expected. Visual Studio is the industry IDE of choice for C#, so you will need to become familiar with it over your time at EDA.

Before getting started on the challenges please look over the file  
[Anatomy of an EDA C# VS Challenge](challenge-anatomy.md)

PluralSight is a treasure trove of information and learning opportunities - we have put together some videos to watch but feel free to look for others and share any recommended ones via slack.

#Week 5: Algorithms

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. 

##Microsoft Virtual Academy

Watch these chapters of the tutorial:

1. 

##The Challenges

You are not expected to understand how unit tests work at this stage, but it doesn't hurt to start becoming familiar with them and you can view them on each exercise page by pressing the Show/Hide Tests button at the bottom.

##Challenge Format
Once you're happy with your bit of code, please paste it into the my_solution.cs at each appropriate step (pseudo-code, initial code, refactor, etc).
