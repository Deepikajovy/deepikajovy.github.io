# Algorithms

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. Challenges will all be written in the NET REPL environment, which will compile, run and test your code against specific tests that have been written for each challenge. You are not expected to understand how test units work at this stage, but it doesn't hurt to start becoming familiar with them and you can view them on each exercise page by pressing the Show/Hide Tests button at the bottom.

## Challenge Format

For most of the following challenges you'll be using NET REPL.
NET REPL will allow you to write, execute and test code within a web environment. Once you're happy with your bit of code, please paste it into the my_solution.cs at each appropriate step (pseudo-code, intiial code, refactor, etc).


## Challenges
1. [Mathy Challenges](1-mathy-intro) 
2. [Separate Numbers with Commas SOLO CHALLENGE](4-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
3. [Pad an Array](5-pad-array)
4. [Cipher Challenge](6-cipher-challenge) *Pair with a person in your cohort*
5. [Technical Blog](8-technical-blog.md)
6. [Cultural Blog](9-cultural-blog.md)

## Working through the Challenges
- Fork this (phase-0-unit-2) repository by clicking "Fork" at the top right of the page.
- Enable "issues" in the settings for the repo, like you did for phase-0-unit-1. This will allow people to give you feedback.
- Clone the `phase-0-unit-2` repository from the command line to your computer.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the 'my_solution.rb' files or the spec files.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.  
  
**if you do not finish by the deadline:**  
  
- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V)
