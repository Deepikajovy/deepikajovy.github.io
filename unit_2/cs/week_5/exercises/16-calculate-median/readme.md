#Calculate the Median

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Use  integers, arrays, and/or hashes
- Use if/else statements and/or while/until loops

## Summary:

Write a method `Median` which takes an `ArrayList` of numbers as its input and returns the median value.

You might want to look up the definition of "median."

For example the driver code might look like this:
(Driver code is code that uses a method.)

```cs
Median for the ArrayList [1,2,3] should result in '2'
Median for the ArrayList [4.5,0,-1] should result in '0'
Median for the ArrayList [-100,100] should result in '0.0'
```

ToDo:
1. Open the exercise and carefully read the instructions![relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/16).
2. [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md).
3. Add and commit your changes.
4. Write your best Initial Solution (Remember this is off of memory).
5. Refactor the initial solution to pass the tests in NetRepl.
6. Peek at the solution and if you dont understand something put a post on slack and start a discussion.
7. Add, commit and push your code up to GitHub.

Pro-Tip: ArrayList is a variable size collecion for objects stored in sequence, it is also its own type and may be passed around as you would a string or int.
