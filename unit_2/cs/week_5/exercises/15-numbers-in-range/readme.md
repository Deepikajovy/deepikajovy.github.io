#Get the numbers in a range

## Learning Competencies
- Write kick ass pseudocode
- Write a method
- Read data from a data structure
- Use primitive types - string, int, hash etc...

## Summary, The user stories:

Write a method `CountBetween` which takes takes three arguments as input - ArrayList numbers, int lowerBound and int upperBound.

CountBetween should return the number of integers in the ArrayList between the two bounds, including the bounds

It should return 0 if the ArrayList is empty.

Some examples:

```cs
// Psueodo-Driver code
CountBetween for the ArrayList [1,2,3] and arguments 0 and 0 should result in '3'
CountBetween for the ArrayList [-10,1,2] and arguments 0 and 0 should result in '2'
CountBetween for the ArrayList [10,20,30] and arguments 10 and 30 should result in '3'

// You will see lines similar to this in the tests - this code drives the app, ie it uses it to make stuff happen.
CountBetween (ArrayList [], -100,100)  - should result in '0'
CountBetween (ArrayList [0], 0, 0) - should result in '1'
```

ToDo:
1. Open the exercise and carefully read the instructions! [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/15)  
2. [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)  
3. Add and commit your changes  
4. Write your best Initial Solution (Remember this is off of memory)  
5. Refactor the initial solution to pass the tests in NetRepl  
6. Peek at the solution and if you don't understand something put a post on slack and start a discussion.  
7. Add, commit and push your code up to GitHub  

Pro-Tip: It will be tempting to just dive in and start to short cut eg skip Pseudocoding. Don't!!! if you feel its taking to long - time box it and add to it later. Pseudocoding involves thinking through how you will solve a task and in a way is the creative part of programming and is language agnostic - ie by Pseudocoding you are programming and really it is then just a case of learning the syntax, peculiarities and extra features of a language.

PS: C# Rules!!!
