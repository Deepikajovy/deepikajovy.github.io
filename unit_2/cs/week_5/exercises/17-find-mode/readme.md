#Calculate the Mode

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes


## Summary, The user stories:

Write a method `Mode` which takes an `ArrayList` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `ArrayList` of the most frequent values.

If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `ArrayList`.

For example the driver code might look like this:
(Driver code is code that uses a method.)

```cs
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 2, 3, 3] should result in [3]
Mode for the ArrayList [4.5, 0, 0] should result in [0]
Mode for the ArrayList [1.5, -1, 1, 1.5] should result in [1, 5]
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 1, 2, 2] should result in [1, 2]
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 2, 3] should result in [1, 2, 3] because all occur with equal frequency
```
ToDo:
1. Open the exercise and carefully read the instructions! [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/17).  
2. [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md).  
3. Add and commit your changes.  
4. Write your best Initial Solution (Remember this is off of memory).  
5. Refactor the initial solution to pass the tests in NetRepl.  
6. Peek at the solution and if you dont understand something put a post on slack and start a discussion.  
7. Add, commit and push your code up to GitHub.  

Pro-Tip: Practice making lots of small commits to git - with descriptive messages. This will focus your time to solving a particular part of the problem as well as making it far easier to undo mistakes, as the messages will provide a synopsis of what happened on each commit.
