# Cipher Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Decompose a problem into smaller, easier to solve components
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code

## Summary
The N.S.A. just broke Kim Jong Un's cipher that he's been using to give instructions to his military commanders! We wrote the following program to decipher the messages. As the N.S.A.'s best programmer on staff, your job is to refactor the code.

You should work with a person in your accountability group to complete this challenge.

In this challenge, you'll work with a pair to refactor some existing code to make it more readable and follow best practices. Then you will compare your solution with the other pair(s) in your accountability group.

## Challenge Format

This challenge has a slightly different format from the others, we will be using Visual Studio or Xamarin for this one. Most of you should have Visual Studio installed, if you haven't simply go to the [PC setup]() page in the hand book and follow the intstructions there. A project for each has been created	 simply open the one that s


## Release 0: Run the code
Copy the code from within [my_solution.cs](my_solution.cs) in your choice of environment, execute it and look at the output. You should see a few different "I am comparing x and y" statements, and on the last line "I want a coke!".

## Release 1: Read the code
Identify what each line of code is doing.
Write comments next to or above each line with an explanation.
Really focus on breaking each step down. You want to understand every line. **Commit your changes.*

## Release 2: [Refactor (by rewriting) the initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)
  - Clean up the variable names.
  - The original code used a hard-coded hash to do the encryption. Can you create a simple algorithm instead? The original shift was by 4 characters. What would happen if it was changed to 10? **Commit your changes.*
