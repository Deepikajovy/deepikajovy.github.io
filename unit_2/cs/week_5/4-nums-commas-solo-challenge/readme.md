# U2.W4: Separate Numbers with Commas

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary
Write a method `SeparateComma` which takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string.  Like this:

```cs
SeparateComma(1000)    // => "1,000"
SeparateComma(1000000) // => "1,000,000"
SeparateComma(0)       // => "0"
SeparateComma(100)     // => "100"
```

*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge, it's all about the logic!*

## Release 0: Open the exercise page in NET REPL
Go to the [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/34) page in NET REPL. Pay attention to the explanation and requirements out-lined at the top of the file.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 2: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md) 
Write your initial solution in C# and make sure it passes all the tests. Press the "Compile and Test!" button and that will run your code and test it against the specific test units. You pass all the tests when you get all green text, otherwise it will explain which test case is failing.

*commit your changes*

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) 
Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution.cs` file. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes to Github
When you feel confident with your solution, push your changes through the command line to your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
