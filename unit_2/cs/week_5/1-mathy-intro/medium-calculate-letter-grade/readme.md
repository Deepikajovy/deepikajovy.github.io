# U2.W4: Calculate a Letter Grade

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode 
- Find and use built-in C# .NET methods to solve challenges
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops


## Summary:
Create a method `GetGrade` that accepts an `ArrayList` of test scores.  Each score in the array should be between `0` and `100`, where
`100` is the max score.

Compute the average score and return the letter grade as a `String`, i.e., `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, or `'F'`.

For example,

```cs
# How studious!
GetGrade for the ArrayList [100, 100, 100] should result in 'A'
```

## Release 0: Open the exercise page in NET REPL
Go to the [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/14) page in NET REPL. Pay attention to the explanation and requirements out-lined at the top of the file.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 2: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md) 
Write your initial solution in C# and make sure it passes all the tests. Press the "Compile and Test!" button and that will run your code and test it against the specific test units. You pass all the tests when you get all green text, otherwise it will explain which test case is failing.

*commit your changes*

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) 
Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution.cs` file. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes to Github
When you feel confident with your solution, push your changes through the command line to your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
