# U2.W4: Calculate the Mode


## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes


## Summary:

Write a method `Mode` which takes an `ArrayList` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `ArrayList` of the most frequent values.

If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `ArrayList`.

For example,

```cs
For example,
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 2, 3, 3] should result in [3]
Mode for the ArrayList [4.5, 0, 0] should result in [0]
Mode for the ArrayList [1.5, -1, 1, 1.5] should result in [1, 5]
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 1, 2, 2] should result in [1, 2]
Mode for the ArrayList [1, 2, 3] should result in [1, 2, 3] because all occur with equal frequency
```


## Release 0: Open the exercise page in NET REPL
Go to the [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/17) page in NET REPL. Pay attention to the explanation and requirements out-lined at the top of the file.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 2: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md) 
Write your initial solution in C# and make sure it passes all the tests. Press the "Compile and Test!" button and that will run your code and test it against the specific test units. You pass all the tests when you get all green text, otherwise it will explain which test case is failing.

*commit your changes*

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) 
Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution.cs` file. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes to Github
When you feel confident with your solution, push your changes through the command line to your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
