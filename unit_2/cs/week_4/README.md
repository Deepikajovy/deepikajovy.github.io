# Week 4: Introduction to C-Sharp

<!-- Week 4's material is not ready yet!

We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before the week begins. -->

It's time to fetch changes from the phase-0-version-2.0 master repo. Make sure you are in the master branch of your forked phase-0-version-2.0 repo.  Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.

C# Labs
-------

For many challenges in the C# stream of Phase 0 you will be using a custom made [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) environment, called NET REPL.

Our custom NET REPL also contains an instructional section with associated exercises, called Labs.

Through this week we'll be using the Labs extensively, so the first thing you'll want to to this week is head over to Enspiral's [NET REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info) 

* Username: devacademy
* Password: iamnice

On the left hand side, navigate to [Labs](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs) and read through all the material, but do not yet attempt any of the exercises.

Once you're familiar with the core concepts, you can start going through the challenges and review specific chapters of the Labs to complete the exercises.

## Challenges:

1. [Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment](1-numbers-letters)
2. [Methods](2-methods)
3. [Flow Control](3-flow-control)
4. [Arrays, Iterators, and Hashes](4-arrays)
5. [GPS 1.2](9-gps1-2) **Do not look at this until your guided pairing session!**
8. [Accountability Groups](10-accountability-groups.md)

## Submitting your work

- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.  

**if you do not finish by the deadline:**

- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V)

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. You should also try to figure out a fix -- it will help your markdown skills!
