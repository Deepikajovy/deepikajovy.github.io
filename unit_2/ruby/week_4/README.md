# Week 4: Intro to Ruby

This week you get to start Ruby! These tutorials and exercises will help you build a basic Ruby toolkit. When working through the exercises, you may find it helpful to work with others from your cohort.

In the first bit of the Ruby Foundations Tutorial, there's a video called "Installing Ruby". You can skip this video if you already have Ruby installed on your machine.

If you need, you can review [these guidelines](../../../phase-0-handbook/submission-guidelines) on submitting challenges.

Also, before starting this week, make sure to fetch any curriculum changes from the main phase-0-version-2.0 repo. If you've forgotten how, check out these [instructions](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md).
