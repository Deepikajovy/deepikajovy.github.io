# Week 5: Algorithms 

Last week you built up a toolkit of ruby methods. You practiced with them and gained a good intuition of how they work, what they're used for, and so on. This week you'll use that toolkit to solve some more complex problems.

You have a group pairing session and an optional group project this week. Meow.
