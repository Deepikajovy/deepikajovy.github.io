# Week 5: Algorithms 

Last week you built up a toolkit of ruby methods. You practiced with them and gained a good intuition of how they work, what they're used for, and so on. This week you'll use that toolkit to solve some more complex problems.

2. [Pad An Array](./2-pad-array)
3. [GPS: Calculate the Mode](./3-calculate-mode)
4. [Calculate a Letter Grade](./calculate-letter-grade)
5. [Calculate the Median](./calculate-median)
6. [Research Methods](./4-research-methods)
7. [Separate Numbers with Commas](./5-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
